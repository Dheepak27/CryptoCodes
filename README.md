This repository contains Python implementations of various foundational cryptographic algorithms and techniques:

- AES Encryption  
- AES Key Expansion  
- Caesar Cipher  
- Columnar Cipher  
- Digital Signature Standards (DSS)  
- ElGamal Cryptography  
- Hill Cipher  
- HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)  
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (with a Man-in-the-Middle Attack demonstration)  
- Playfair Cipher  
- Rail Fence Cipher  
- RSA Algorithm  
- Simple DES  
- SHA-512 Hashing  

The `client.py` script is used for encryption, and `server.py` is used for decryption.
