This repository contains implementations of various foundational cryptographic algorithms and techniques. It is intended as a learning resource and demonstration of core cryptographic principles.

- AES Encryption  
- AES Key Expansion  
- Caesar Cipher  
- Columnar Cipher  
- Digital Signature Standards (DSS)  
- ElGamal Cryptography  
- Hill Cipher  
- HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)  
- Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange (with a Man-in-the-Middle Attack demonstration)  
- Playfair Cipher  
- Rail Fence Cipher  
- RSA Algorithm  
- Simple DES  
- SHA-512 Hashing  

All programs in this repository were manually implemented for educational purposes and were **not copied from online sources**. Due to their academic nature, they may not cover all edge cases or work in every scenario. These implementations are best used for learning and conceptual understanding.

The `client.py` script is used for encryption, and `server.py` is used for decryption.

To run any Python file:

```bash
python filename.py
